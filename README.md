## TicTacToe app

A basic tictactoe written with Javascript (ES2015), React.js, Redux & Webpack.

Function:

* The AI will make a move after the user take it
* Not fully functional, the AI is kind of stupid for now (the problem with Minimax recursion implementation), I'll come back to it later.

### Development

To try this out, run `npm install` & `npm start`.  Then browse to `localhost:8080` in your browser.
